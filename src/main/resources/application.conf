# This is the main configuration file for the application.
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ConfigFile
# ~~~~~
# Play uses HOCON as its configuration file format.  HOCON has a number
# of advantages over other config formats, but there are two things that
# can be used when modifying settings.
#
# You can include other configuration files in this main application.conf file:
#include "extra-config.conf"
#
# You can declare variables and substitute for them:
#mykey = ${some.value}
#
# And if an environment variable exists when there is no other subsitution, then
# HOCON will fall back to substituting environment variable:
#mykey = ${JAVA_HOME}

## Akka
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaAkka#Configuration
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaAkka#Configuration
# ~~~~~
# Play uses Akka internally and exposes Akka Streams and actors in Websockets and
# other streaming HTTP responses.
akka {
  # "akka.log-config-on-start" is extraordinarly useful because it log the complete
  # configuration at INFO level, including defaults and overrides, so it s worth
  # putting at the very top.
  #
  # Put the following in your conf/logback.xml file:
  #
  # <logger name="akka.actor" level="INFO" />
  #
  # And then uncomment this line to debug the configuration.
  #
  log-config-on-start = false

    default-dispatcher {
      # This will be used if you have set "executor = "fork-join-executor""
      fork-join-executor {
        # Min number of threads to cap factor-based parallelism number to
        parallelism-min = 8

        # The parallelism factor is used to determine thread pool size using the
        # following formula: ceil(available processors * factor). Resulting size
        # is then bounded by the parallelism-min and parallelism-max values.
        parallelism-factor = 1.0

        # Max number of threads to cap factor-based parallelism number to
        parallelism-max = 64

        # Setting to "FIFO" to use queue like peeking mode which "poll" or "LIFO" to use stack
        # like peeking mode which "pop".
        # Setting this to LIFO changes the fork-join-executor
        # to use a stack discipline for task scheduling. This usually
        # improves throughput at the cost of possibly increasing
        # latency and risking task starvation (which should be rare).

## Secret key

# You can also extend Play functionality by using one of the publically available
# Play modules: https://playframework.com/documentation/latest/ModuleDirectory

# ~~~~~
# The HTTP client primarily used for REST APIs.  The default client can be

## Cache
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaCache
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaCache
# ~~~~~
# Play comes with an integrated cache API that can reduce the operational
# overhead of repeated requests. You must enable this by adding to build.sbt:
#
# libraryDependencies += cache
#
play.cache {
  # If you want to bind several caches, you can bind the individually
  #bindCaches = ["db-cache", "user-cache", "session-cache"]

  ## CORS filter configuration
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/CorsFilter

  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaCsrf#Applying-a-global-CSRF-filter
  # ~~~~~
  # Play supports multiple methods for verifying that a request is not a CSRF request.
  # The primary mechanism is a CSRF token. This token gets placed either in the query string
  # or body of every form submitted, and also gets placed in the users session.
  # Play then verifies that both tokens are present and match.
  csrf {

  ## Security headers filter configuration

  ## Allowed hosts filter configuration
